This inspection reports <b>static</b> variables which are read prior to initialization.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate whether you want uninitialized primitive fields to be reported.

Note: This inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report static variables
used uninitialized incorrectly. Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.

This inspection reports reads of instance variables which are not yet initialized.
<p>
Use the checkbox below to indicate whether you want uninitialized primitive fields to be reported.

Note: This inspection uses a very conservative dataflow algorithm, and may report instance variables
as uninitialized incorrectly. Variables reported as initialized will always be initialized.

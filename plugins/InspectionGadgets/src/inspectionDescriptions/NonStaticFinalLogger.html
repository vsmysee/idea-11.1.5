This inspection reports logger fields on classes which are not declared <b>static</b>.
and <b>final</b>.
Ensuring that every classes logger is effectively constant and bound to that class
simplifies the task of providing a unified logging implementation for an application. Interfaces,
enumerations, annotations, inner classes, and abstract classes are not reported by this inspection.
<p>

This inspection reports classes which do not have a logger declared.
Ensuring that every class has a dedicated logger is an important step in providing a unified logging
implementation for an application. Interfaces, enumerations, annotations, inner classes, and abstract classes are not reported by this inspection.
<p>
Use the field below to specify the name of the class which will be used for logging in this project.
Classes which do not declare a field of that class will be reported by this inspection.

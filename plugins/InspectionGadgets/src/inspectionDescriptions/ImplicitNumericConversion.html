This inspection reports implicit conversion between numeric types.
Implicit numeric conversion is not a problem in itself, but if unexpected may be a source
of difficult to trace bugs.
<p>
Use the first checkbox below if you wish this inspection to ignore implicit conversions which
can not result in loss of data (e.g.
<b>int</b>-><b>long</b>).
<br>Use the second checkbox to indicate that this inspection should ignore all conversions from
and to <b>char</b>.
<br>Use the third checkbox to let this inspection ignore all conversions from literals and
compile time constants.
